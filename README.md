Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This project aims to create an AI-based scientific consultant with an extensive database of scientific articles in biology, biotechnology, biochemistry, genetics, and related fields. It will help design experiments, discuss results, and provide rapid comparisons with numerous articles.

## Background

This project addresses several problems:
* The time-consuming process of searching and reading scientific articles.
* The need for a centralized platform where laboratories can upload protocols for various techniques.
* The challenge of designing experiments and discussing results efficiently.

My personal motivation is to streamline scientific research and make it more accessible and efficient. This topic is important because it can significantly accelerate scientific discoveries and innovations.

## How is it used?

The AI consultant will be used in research laboratories and academic institutions. Researchers can upload their protocols, design experiments, and discuss results with the AI. The AI will compare the results with a vast database of scientific articles, providing rapid insights and suggestions.

## Data sources and AI methods

The data will come from scientific databases and journals. Researchers will also contribute by uploading their protocols and experimental results.

## Challenges

This project does not solve the issue of data privacy and security. Ethical considerations include ensuring the AI does not provide misleading information and maintaining the confidentiality of unpublished research.

## What next?

To grow this project, we need collaboration with scientific journals and databases to access a wide range of articles. We also need skilled AI developers and data scientists to improve the AI's capabilities.
